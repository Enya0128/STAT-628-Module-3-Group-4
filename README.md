### Project Introduction

This is a course project to analysis Yelp data. Yelp is an Internet company to "help people find great local businesses" by providing a platform for users to write review of businesses. As users of Yelp APP, we have realized the convenience of using it to find delicious food or great service. Moreover, in order to make better use of the data in Yelp, we hope to get some advice to the business owners through data analysis, which will help improve the quality of the businesses.

Because there are various kinds of businesses in Yelp APP, in order to provide more specific advice, we just choose one type of businesses: Mexican Restaurant. The reason why we choose them is that Mexican food is one of the popular foods in USA and Canada, we can get a large enough dataset to do analysis and finally get useful results.

In our data analysis, we do text processing and exploratory data analysis (word cloud, Mexican food popularity heatmap and etc). Furthermore, we use linear regression model to give advice about attributes and random forest to select important reviews.

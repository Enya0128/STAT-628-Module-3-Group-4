I got there and waited until 11:25 and still had no breakfast burrito. I asked them about it, they said it was on the way out in a minute. I waited another 5 mins. Needless to say, I left at 11:30 with no food and a refund, since they haven't even started cooking it yet. Not sure I will come back to this location again. The only reason they are getting 2 stars is because the woman up front who I believe is the manager,  was very nice apologized and refunded me my money and provided me a $5 gift card for my time.\",\n"," 'Okay,  obviously anyone who likes this place isn\\'t a native Arizonan who knows what real Mexican food is!  First indication that it was not going to be great was the salsa tasted like it came from a jar.   We ordered a quesadilla which was pretty good,  however the \"guacamole\" was basically pureed avocados.   I ordered the pork green chili burrito with green chili sauce and cheese on top, which was actually pretty good and the pork was really tender.   The rest of the food lacked something to be desired.   \\nWe also discovered a hair in the chips, and then when my daughter got her food,  she found a hair in it as well!  When we told the waitress about the hair,  instead of refunding us for the meal,  she gave us $10 in a gift card, which is worthless since we won\\'t be eating there again.',\n"," \"This review is for the location on Gilbert Road. \\n\\nFirst, I LOVE the food here. I always order Posole to go in addtion to a regular full breakfast.  \\n\\nAlthough I love the food, I'm really over the service and the time it takes to get the meal. Twice I've been here where I ordered the food and it took 45 minutes to get my scrambled egg combo.  They were not busy and only had one other 2-top table in front of me.  I've also been waiting for my food and seen call ahead people come in and wait more than 30 minutes for an order they called ahead for!  \\n\\nI can hear and see the ladies in the kitchen so I know someone is back there, but they are so SLOOOW it's crazy.\\n\\n\\nIf this place can get their service and timing down it'll be a huge hit and a big money maker. If the food continues to take as long to come out, I'll be finding another breakfast place soon.\"]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":134}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"T8_PtcEhswQJ","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"0yrUMA1Vp43_","colab_type":"code","outputId":"23b643d5-0072-4048-917b-fb232ba60832","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1573680372932,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":416,"user":{"displayName":"Zhao Li","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAVIA92TEsceYaqee77DNhEdTOGUCkwprmwfKmo=s64","userId":"01599468407911097211"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"source":["i_list"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":114}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"OnAwqqceo8N9","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["importance_dict = dict(zip(word_list, word_importance))"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
